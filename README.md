# TheHallway's Scripts
These are Python scripts created for [piqueserver](https://github.com/piqueserver/piqueserver), an Ace of Spades 'classic' server implementation.

These scripts are created by and run on [The Hallway](https://discord.gg/ButndsdGua), a CTF server with the original 'hallway' map by izzy.

Fellow server owners are free to install these scripts and adapt them as they wish, since all are licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/lokka30/TheHallwayScripts/blob/main/LICENSE).

We also publish our `bans.txt` here which you may subscribe to. We manually update it (quite often), so it is not the *latest* file from our server.
